TAREA 1 
 
1. Why shouldn´t we call ‘English’ to all the people who live in 
the U.K.? 
Because the United Kingdom is comprised of four distinct countries: England, 
Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. 
• 'British' is the correct term for someone from any of these four nations. 
• 'English' specifically refers only to people from England. 
• People from Scotland are Scots, from Wales are Welsh, and from Northern 
Ireland are Irish. 
 
2. Explain with your own words the meaning of the expression 
“pigeon-hole people”. 
To "pigeon -hole people" means that British people tend to quickly label, 
stereotype, or categorize others, usually based on their social class. 
Although money isn't the only factor now, they pay close attention to things like 
how you speak (your accent), your manners, and your behaviour to decide which 
social "box" you fit into. 
 
3. Explain with your own words the meaning of the expressions 
“stiff upper lip” and “blitz spirit”. 
"Stiff upper lip"  means not showing your feelings when you are stressed, 
embarrassed, or going through a tough time. It's the idea of staying calm and not 
complaining in public. 
 
"Blitz Spirit" is the spirit of solidarity, bravery, and collective optimism that 
emerges when a community or nation faces a great danger or disaster, uniting to 
overcome it. 
 
4. Describe with your own words the British general personality 
towards unknown people, Towards strangers, British people are generally reserved, distant, and 
formal. 
• They are not very open or affectionate and they like to keep 
physical distance when talking. 
• They might seem a little stiff. If you say something that bothers 
them, their face might not change the expression. 
• They take a long time to make friends, but once a friendship is 
established, it tends to be strong and lasting. 
 
5. What could you say about British people privacy? 
Privacy is extremely important to the British. They are very reserved and expect 
others to respect their privacy. This reservation extends to not asking personal 
questions. For example, even close friends avoid asking personal questions, 
especially regarding one’s financial situation or relationships. 
 
6. With your own words, make a brief summary about British 
gift giving etiquette and dining etiquette. 
British people typically exchange gifts for birthdays and Christmas among close 
friends and family. The gift itself does not need to be expensive, but it should be 
thoughtful and relate to the recipient's interests. If you are invited to someone's 
home, it is customary to bring a small present like good quality chocolates, wine, 
or flowers, and these gifts are usually opened when received. Regarding dining, 
the British enjoy entertaining at home, and while punctuality is valued, you may 
arrive 10 -15 minutes  late for dinner at a house, but must be on time for a 
restaurant. They use Continental table manners, holding the fork in the left hand 
and the knife in the right, and you should wait to be invited to sit down. To show 
you have finished eating, you place the knife and fork parallel across the right 
side of the plate. Finally, in a pub, it is common practice to buy a round of drinks 
for everyone in your group. 
 7. With your own words, make a brief summary of everything 
you’ve read about the way British people way of doing 
business. 
The British way of doing business is generally formal and protocol-driven, 
prioritizing long-term relationships over quick deals. Greetings involve a firm 
handshake upon meeting and leaving, and people should be addressed using 
their courtesy titles (Mr, Mrs, Miss) and surname until invited to use a first 
name. Communication often relies on understatement and qualifiers like 
'perhaps' or 'possibly', avoiding exaggerated claims. Both written 
communication and initial emails maintain a high level of formality, steering 
clear of slang. Punctuality is very important in meetings, and decisions are made 
based on facts and figures rather than emotions. Generally, meetings will be 
formal, have a clear purpose, and it is a good idea to send a letter afterwards 
summarizing the agreed-upon next steps.
